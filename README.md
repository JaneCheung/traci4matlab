# Traci4Matlab
TraCI4Matlab is an implementation of the TraCI (Traffic Control Interface) protocol that allows the user to interact with SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility, www.sumo-sim.org) in a client-server scenario in which Matlab acts as the client, and SUMO as the server. TraCI4Matlab is compatible with traci version 8 and previous versions.

Requirements: <br>
MATLAB 8.0 (R2012b) or above <br>
SUMO simulator (www.sumo-sim.org) <br>

Recommended set up: <br>
Add the traci4matlab directory to your Matlab path <br>
Add traci4matlab.jar to the Matlab static java directory <br>
